## My process

### Built with

- **Semantic HTML5 markup**  
  (Using semantic tags like `<main>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`)
- **CSS custom properties (variables)**  
  (Centralized color palette, sizes, border radii, and fonts in `:root`)
- **Flexbox**  
  (For layout structure and vertical/horizontal centering)
- **BEM-inspired class naming**  
  (Classes like `.card__image`, `.card__content` for clarity and maintainability)
- **Accessibility best practices**  
  (Descriptive `alt` attributes for images and secure links with `rel="noopener"`)
- **Google Fonts**  
  (Loading and using the "Figtree" font from Google Fonts)
