## My process

### Built with

- **Semantic HTML5 markup**  
  (Using semantic tags like `<main>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`)
- **CSS custom properties (variables)**  
  (Centralized color palette, sizes, border radii, and fonts in `:root`)
- **Flexbox**  
  (For layout structure and vertical/horizontal centering)
- **BEM-inspired class naming**  
  (Classes like `.card__image`, `.card__content` for clarity and maintainability)
- **Accessibility best practices**  
  (Descriptive `alt` attributes for images and secure links with `rel="noopener"`)
- **Google Fonts**  
  (Loading and using the "Inter" font from Google Fonts)
- **Sass (SCSS syntax)**
  (Using mixins, variables, and modular files to write more efficient and modular CSS)

### What I learned

In this third project I learned about Sass (SCSS Syntax)

I used a combination of SCSS variables and CSS variables because they offer flexibility and maintainability in styling.

Additionally, I utilized multiple SCSS files to enhance modularity.

Finally, I took advantage of mixins to write more efficient and DRY SCSS code, utilizing the new syntax to import files with namespaces, which has replaced the deprecated `@import` rule.

### Continued development

I'd like to continue learning about best practices and cool front-end technologies, such as PWA's, accessibility, and new CSS features.

### Useful resources

I used the [Perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/) tool and the [Windsurf](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Waka.windsurf) VSCode extension to help me review my code as I was building the project. I also used them to get suggestions on best practices, accessibility, and code organization. As a Spanish speaker, I sometimes use these tools to correct or improve my English sentences. I found their feedback and explanations very helpful, and I will use them in future projects.
